# FQ-GAP-CORPUS-REWRITE

Stage: [FINITE_QM_CORE](../stages/FINITE_QM_CORE.md). Status: `OPEN`. Evidence grade: **E3**. [Evidence map overview](../README.md). AuthorityEffect: None.

## Statement

> The whole-program QM rewrite is not complete; the consolidation narrows its scope without discharging it.

## Grade

Evidence grade **E3** (rules in the [overview](../README.md#evidence-grades)). The grade rates the evidence this checkout holds; it is separate from the status.

- counted in-repo evidence files: 2
- cited Lean, Rust or Python symbols found in their in-repo files: 2
- distinct cited Lean declarations covered by a current replay receipt: 2
- counted in-repo runnable tests: 0
- counted in-repo Rust or Python files that are not tests: 0
- recorded statement-match reviews that qualify: 1
- next step to raise the grade: add an in-repo Rust or Python runnable test (0 in-repo Rust or Python file(s) cited, none a test)

## Flags

None. Status and evidence are consistent under the rules in the overview.

## Imported structure

None recorded.

## Bottleneck

Complete or retire the rewrite; no derivation content.

## Source status

GAP-F001-S000-003 (book lifecycle admission); deferred tag in book README

## Review

- PFP review: [dag/results/FQ-GAP-CORPUS-REWRITE/reviews/20261019_scope_audit/review_result.json](../../../dag/results/FQ-GAP-CORPUS-REWRITE/reviews/20261019_scope_audit/review_result.json); file present and sha256 matches the node's record: yes; verdict `scoped_result_or_obstruction_reviewed`; scope effect `consistent`; prior status `OPEN`; qualifies for E4: yes.
  - narrowest claim: The captured source scope is inventoried with exact byte/newline/literal counts and cryptographic source custody; a proper subset cannot discharge a missing obligation.
  - does not support: Create a claim-by-claim whole-corpus rewrite/retirement ledger with original exit contracts and independently checked content; captured filenames and constant flags cannot supply it.
  - next test: Create a claim-by-claim whole-corpus rewrite/retirement ledger with original exit contracts and independently checked content; captured filenames and constant flags cannot supply it.

## Evidence items

Items are grouped by file. "Counts" means the item counts toward the grade: the file is in this checkout, the citation is the node's own (or an exclusive record's), and the file is not a generated view. To list the axioms of a cited Lean declaration, build its module and run `#print axioms <name>` in a scratch file that imports it.
