# PGW-COLLAPSE-WITHOUT-INSTANCES

Stage: [GENESIS](../stages/GENESIS.md). Status: `PROVED_LEAN`. Evidence grade: **E0**. [Evidence map overview](../README.md). AuthorityEffect: None.

## Statement

> With no admitted instances, the derivability of a plugged context depends only on its form, so every pair of data is observationally collapsed (collapsed_of_no_insts). Uniform rules do not change this: a ruled form makes every plugging derivable alike. Retaining another datum alone therefore need not increase expressive power.

## Grade

Evidence grade **E0** (rules in the [overview](../README.md#evidence-grades)). The grade rates the evidence this checkout holds; it is separate from the status.

- counted in-repo evidence files: 0
- cited Lean, Rust or Python symbols found in their in-repo files: 0
- cited Lean declarations covered by a current replay receipt: 0
- counted in-repo runnable tests: 0
- counted in-repo Rust or Python files that are not tests: 0
- recorded statement-match reviews that qualify: 0
- next step to raise the grade: cite at least one in-repo file that bears on the statement

## Flags

- `proved_lean_below_e3`: grade E0; 1 Lean reference(s) cited, 0 in this checkout. PROVED_LEAN below E3: no cited Lean declaration is covered by a current replay receipt.
- `proved_lean_external_only`: all 1 cited Lean reference(s) lie outside this checkout. PROVED_LEAN whose cited Lean lies only in external or sibling-atlas paths, none in this checkout.

## Imported structure

None recorded.

## Bottleneck

The statement covers instance-free regimes only; once an instance is admitted collapse is decided by the profiles, and a later uniform rule can again erase a separation (TFQ-0385).

## Source status

genesis_source.txt section 5 and paper.md section 6 \[theorem\]; Inertia.lean collapsed_of_no_insts

## Review

No recorded statement-match review.

## Evidence items

Items are grouped by file. "Counts" means the item counts toward the grade: the file is in this checkout, the citation is the node's own (or an exclusive record's), and the file is not a generated view. To list the axioms of a cited Lean declaration, build its module and run `#print axioms <name>` in a scratch file that imports it.
