# DS-QM094-EVERETT-RELATIVE-STATE-CONTACT

Stage: [FINITE_QM_STRUCTURE](../stages/FINITE_QM_STRUCTURE.md). Status: `COMPUTATIONALLY_CHECKED`. Evidence grade: **E3**. [Evidence map overview](../README.md). AuthorityEffect: None.

## Statement

> Under an imported finite Hilbert/tensor/partial-trace package, orthogonal records make the reduced state diagonal; Phi_off bounds expectation differences; equal local L1 shadows can hide distinguishable coherent states. Holonomy alone selecting a branch basis is NoRule; relative-state representation does not entail many-worlds ontology (refused); Everettian probability from branch weights is an open obstruction.

## Grade

Evidence grade **E3** (rules in the [overview](../README.md#evidence-grades)). The grade rates the evidence this checkout holds; it is separate from the status.

- counted in-repo evidence files: 2
- cited Lean, Rust or Python symbols found in their in-repo files: 5
- distinct cited Lean declarations covered by a current replay receipt: 4
- counted in-repo runnable tests: 0
- counted in-repo Rust or Python files that are not tests: 1
- recorded statement-match reviews that qualify: 0
- next step to raise the grade: add an in-repo Rust or Python runnable test (1 in-repo Rust or Python file(s) cited, none a test) and a recorded statement-match review

## Flags

- `computational_no_runnable_test`: 1 in-repo Rust or Python symbol(s) cited, none a test. COMPUTATIONALLY_CHECKED with no in-repo runnable Rust or Python test cited.

## Imported structure

None recorded.

## Bottleneck

Checked on fixed exact matrices natively. The cited Lean has scalar identities only; the reduced-state statement is not in Lean.

## Source status

QCE-C1..C12 Everett relative-state reduced-density record-overlap formula (off-diagonal c0*c1*r vanishing at r=0), Pythagorean isometric child-branch norm conservation, and global swap observable distinguishability vs diagonal collapse (4 != 2) mechanized in DerivationDagQMClosure.lean and mirrored in finite_quantum_mechanics

## Review

- PFP review: [dag/results/DS-QM094-EVERETT-RELATIVE-STATE-CONTACT/reviews/20261019_boundaries_audit/review_result.json](../../../dag/results/DS-QM094-EVERETT-RELATIVE-STATE-CONTACT/reviews/20261019_boundaries_audit/review_result.json); file present and sha256 matches the node's record: yes; verdict `scoped_result_or_obstruction_reviewed`; scope effect `status_lowered`; prior status `PROVED_LEAN`; qualifies for E4: no.
  - narrowest claim: Actual relative-state density, partial trace and expectation controls are exact; the scalar orthogonality and absolute-bound identities are kernel checked.
  - does not support: Prove the full tensor/partial-trace coordinate bridge and justify a physical record basis/probability rule. No branch selection or many-worlds ontology follows.
  - next test: Prove the full tensor/partial-trace coordinate bridge and justify a physical record basis/probability rule. No branch selection or many-worlds ontology follows.

## Evidence items

Items are grouped by file. "Counts" means the item counts toward the grade: the file is in this checkout, the citation is the node's own (or an exclusive record's), and the file is not a generated view. To list the axioms of a cited Lean declaration, build its module and run `#print axioms <name>` in a scratch file that imports it.
