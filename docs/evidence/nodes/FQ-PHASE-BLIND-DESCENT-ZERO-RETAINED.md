# FQ-PHASE-BLIND-DESCENT-ZERO-RETAINED

Stage: [FINITE_QM_CORE](../stages/FINITE_QM_CORE.md). Status: `COMPUTATIONALLY_CHECKED`. Evidence grade: **E3**. [Evidence map overview](../README.md). AuthorityEffect: None.

## Statement

> A matrix A descends through the phase-blind population report iff every row has at most one nonzero entry, provided the quotient retains the zero vector as a distinct output; without the retained zero point the claim is false on projective space (A = \[\[1,1\],\[1,1\]\]).

## Grade

Evidence grade **E3** (rules in the [overview](../README.md#evidence-grades)). The grade rates the evidence this checkout holds; it is separate from the status.

- counted in-repo evidence files: 3
- cited Lean, Rust or Python symbols found in their in-repo files: 3
- distinct cited Lean declarations covered by a current replay receipt: 3
- counted in-repo runnable tests: 0
- counted in-repo Rust or Python files that are not tests: 0
- recorded statement-match reviews that qualify: 0
- next step to raise the grade: add an in-repo Rust or Python runnable test (0 in-repo Rust or Python file(s) cited, none a test) and a recorded statement-match review

## Flags

- `computational_no_runnable_test`: 0 in-repo Rust or Python symbol(s) cited, none a test. COMPUTATIONALLY_CHECKED with no in-repo runnable Rust or Python test cited.

## Imported structure

- sector basis and quadratic readout (assumption)

## Bottleneck

Lean states the 2x2 integer case (descent_compatible_iff_row_sparse). The n x n statement is not in Lean; the all-ones counterexample on projective space is a native check.

## Source status

General-n row-sparsity characterization and projective-zero counterexample mechanized in DerivationDagQMClosure.lean and BornRedundancy.lean

## Review

- PFP review: [dag/results/FQ-PHASE-BLIND-DESCENT-ZERO-RETAINED/reviews/20261019_scope_audit/review_result.json](../../../dag/results/FQ-PHASE-BLIND-DESCENT-ZERO-RETAINED/reviews/20261019_scope_audit/review_result.json); file present and sha256 matches the node's record: yes; verdict `scoped_result_or_obstruction_reviewed`; scope effect `status_lowered`; prior status `PROVED_LEAN`; qualifies for E4: no.
  - narrowest claim: Exact integer population descent iff every row is sparse is rechecked generally. The all-ones zero-cancellation control is explicit; native cross-term differences are 4abxy and 4cdxy.
  - does not support: Prove the advertised normalized/projective characterization, with its exact carrier and retained-zero convention, separately; do not promote the stronger-looking target wording from the integer theorem.
  - next test: Prove the advertised normalized/projective characterization, with its exact carrier and retained-zero convention, separately; do not promote the stronger-looking target wording from the integer theorem.

## Evidence items

Items are grouped by file. "Counts" means the item counts toward the grade: the file is in this checkout, the citation is the node's own (or an exclusive record's), and the file is not a generated view. To list the axioms of a cited Lean declaration, build its module and run `#print axioms <name>` in a scratch file that imports it.
