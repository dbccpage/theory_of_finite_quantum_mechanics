# MUB6-HAAGERUP-MATRIX-CHM

Stage: [MUTUALLY_UNBIASED_BASES](../stages/MUTUALLY_UNBIASED_BASES.md). Status: `PROVED_LEAN`. Evidence grade: **E3**. [Evidence map overview](../README.md). AuthorityEffect: None.

## Statement

> The explicit 6x6 matrix haagerupMatrix with entries in {1, -1, i} has unit-modulus entries and H H* = 6I.

## Grade

Evidence grade **E3** (rules in the [overview](../README.md#evidence-grades)). The grade rates the evidence this checkout holds; it is separate from the status.

- counted in-repo evidence files: 4
- cited Lean, Rust or Python symbols found in their in-repo files: 1
- cited Lean declaration references covered by a current replay receipt: 1
- counted in-repo runnable tests: 0
- counted in-repo Rust or Python files that are not tests: 0
- recorded statement-match reviews that qualify: 0
- next step to raise the grade: add an in-repo Rust or Python runnable test (0 in-repo Rust or Python file(s) cited, none a test) and a recorded statement-match review

## Flags

None. Status and evidence are consistent under the rules in the overview.

## Imported structure

None recorded.

## Bottleneck

The source one-parameter family H6(q) without 2x2 or 3x3 Hadamard sub-blocks is not constructed; matching this matrix to the Haagerup source and to any exclusion theorem is an open step.

## Source status

papers/core/mub6/theory_of_finite_mub6.jsonl record MUB6-DERIV-058 claims PROVED_LEAN; audited status PROVED_LEAN

## Review

No recorded statement-match review.

## Evidence items

Items are grouped by file. "Counts" means the item counts toward the grade: the file is in this checkout, the citation is the node's own (or an exclusive record's), and the file is not a generated view. To list the axioms of a cited Lean declaration, build its module and run `#print axioms <name>` in a scratch file that imports it.
