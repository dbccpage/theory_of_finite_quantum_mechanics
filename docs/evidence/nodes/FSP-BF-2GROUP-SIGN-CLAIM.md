# FSP-BF-2GROUP-SIGN-CLAIM

Stage: [FERMION_SIGN](../stages/FERMION_SIGN.md). Status: `OPEN`. Evidence grade: **E1**. [Evidence map overview](../README.md). AuthorityEffect: None.

## Statement

> Claimed: in BF theory on finite cell complexes, the Postnikov class in H^3(G, A) governs cancellation of higher 2-group sign anomalies on knotted worldsheets; no BF model, linking computation or cancellation identity exists in this checkout.

## Grade

Evidence grade **E1** (rules in the [overview](../README.md#evidence-grades)). The grade rates the evidence this checkout holds; it is separate from the status.

- counted in-repo evidence files: 3
- cited Lean, Rust or Python symbols found in their in-repo files: 0
- distinct cited Lean declarations covered by a current replay receipt: 0
- counted in-repo runnable tests: 0
- counted in-repo Rust or Python files that are not tests: 0
- recorded statement-match reviews that qualify: 0
- next step to raise the grade: cite a Lean, Rust or Python symbol that exists in an in-repo file

## Flags

None. Status and evidence are consistent under the rules in the overview.

## Imported structure

None recorded.

## Bottleneck

Define the finite BF or 2-group gauge model, compute the 3-loop braiding phases and state exactly which weights become nonnegative; ledger GIN-C19 to GIN-C21 withdraw the fixture readings.

## Source status

papers/core/fsp/theory_of_finite_fsp.jsonl record FSP-DERIV-046 claims PROVED_LEAN; audited status OPEN

## Review

No recorded statement-match review.

## Evidence items

Items are grouped by file. "Counts" means the item counts toward the grade: the file is in this checkout, the citation is the node's own (or an exclusive record's), and the file is not a generated view. To list the axioms of a cited Lean declaration, build its module and run `#print axioms <name>` in a scratch file that imports it.
