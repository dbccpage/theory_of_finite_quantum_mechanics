# L1-QM020-THM2B-MINKOWSKI

Stage: [L1_TO_L2](../stages/L1_TO_L2.md). Status: `IMPORTED_ASSUMPTION`. Evidence grade: **E3**. [Evidence map overview](../README.md). AuthorityEffect: None.

## Statement

> Strict l^p (p\>1) subadditivity on disjoint supports follows from standard Minkowski / strict convexity. The paper cites it as standard analysis.

## Grade

Evidence grade **E3** (rules in the [overview](../README.md#evidence-grades)). The grade rates the evidence this checkout holds; it is separate from the status.

- counted in-repo evidence files: 2
- cited Lean, Rust or Python symbols found in their in-repo files: 2
- cited Lean declarations covered by a current replay receipt: 2
- counted in-repo runnable tests: 0
- counted in-repo Rust or Python files that are not tests: 0
- recorded statement-match reviews that qualify: 1
- next step to raise the grade: add an in-repo Rust or Python runnable test (0 in-repo Rust or Python file(s) cited, none a test)

## Flags

None. Status and evidence are consistent under the rules in the overview.

## Imported structure

- real analysis (Minkowski, strict convexity): assumption

## Bottleneck

Not mechanized.

## Source status

Thm 2b STANDARD / imported real analysis; audit: imported

## Review

- PFP review: [dag/results/L1-QM020-THM2B-MINKOWSKI/reviews/20261020_born_boundary_audit/delivery_review_result.json](../../../dag/results/L1-QM020-THM2B-MINKOWSKI/reviews/20261020_born_boundary_audit/delivery_review_result.json); file present and sha256 matches the node's record: yes; verdict `scoped_result_or_obstruction_reviewed`; scope effect `consistent`; prior status `IMPORTED_ASSUMPTION`; qualifies for E4: yes.
  - narrowest claim: Exact natural-power strictness/equality controls, with general p2 positivity and p3 algebra in Lean.
  - does not support: Discharge the full real-p Minkowski/strict-convexity import and arbitrary-vector transport. Zero vectors are equality cases, not strict cases.
  - next test: Discharge the full real-p Minkowski/strict-convexity import and arbitrary-vector transport. Zero vectors are equality cases, not strict cases.

## Evidence items

Items are grouped by file. "Counts" means the item counts toward the grade: the file is in this checkout, the citation is the node's own (or an exclusive record's), and the file is not a generated view. To list the axioms of a cited Lean declaration, build its module and run `#print axioms <name>` in a scratch file that imports it.
