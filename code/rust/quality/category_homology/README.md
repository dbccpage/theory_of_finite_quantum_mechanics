# Category theory and homology scoring

AuthorityEffect: None.

Each Rust source in the two directories has an adjacent `name.score.yaml`.
These are SCORING.md v2 records, not contracts. Contract paths remain pending.
The architecture target is L5 and the engineering target is A. Capability
levels describe delivered behavior: a re-export stays L1, a metadata shell
stays L2, and an admitted certificate checker can be L5.

Null gates mean unassessed. A passing package suite, a source hash, or a good
mutation ratio does not automatically award every file A. In particular, the
current records do not certify all failure classes, consumer composition,
macro-expanded flow, resource bounds, or external dependency provenance. The compatibility root
`category_theory/mod.rs` is distinguished from the actual crate entry `lib.rs`.

The homology core checks exact rational rank certificates using `M = UV`,
`LU = I`, and `VR = I`. The certificate checker does not trust elimination.
Its canonical carrier owns immutable admitted cochain data and rank evidence.
Raw candidate certificates remain untrusted until admitted. Rust's unchecked
`BigRational::new_raw` path, deserialization, basis mismatches, degree overflow,
and malformed simplices receive explicit admission checks.
Rank-zero production now handles zero-area matrices independently of metadata
dimensions, including `0 x usize::MAX`. Row-reduction and inverse failures keep
their typed sources. The rank review maps all 15 production symbols to an exact
algebraic specification and audits its canonical-carrier consumers. Its Lean
model proves the rank conclusion, explicit refusal, first-error preservation and
index bounds. The accompanying source review maps Rust construction and error
paths to that model under the declared exact-arithmetic/runtime boundary. This
does not claim mechanized Rust/MIR refinement or machine-checked crash freedom.

The category core owns law-checked finite endpoints and functor maps. Metadata
catalogs remain declarations; their mathematical names do not establish their
advertised structures. Some public APIs now return `Result`/`Option`, and
certificate fields are read-only. Weighted records use `BigRational`.

Natural-transformation admission checks lawful categories and total lawful
functors, exact component domains and every square. Certificates own their
endpoint context. The formerly disabled composition module now builds and
checks identities, vertical composition and horizontal composition, rejecting
different contexts even when names agree. Independent cyclic-group arithmetic
challenges exercise associativity and interchange. Raw declared operations
assemble candidates; only checked operations return admitted certificates.

The rewriting module admits finite globular declarations; its legacy Infinity
names do not establish an infinity-category. Owned, immutable context binds
normal-form witnesses and decreasing-rank termination certificates. Rank
admission checks the exact term domain and strict descent independently of
the iterative topological-sort producer. Directed graph analysis uses forward
edges; formal inverse paths cannot establish forward local confluence.
Whiskering checks fresh names and admission before committing a candidate.
The challenge suite compares all 512 directed graphs on three vertices with a
Boolean Floyd-Warshall oracle and checks a 20,000-node chain without recursion.

The strict 2-category module now owns checked underlying and vertical categories.
It checks globularity, exact horizontal composition domain and boundaries,
strict units, horizontal associativity, identity preservation and interchange.
Boundary and identity queries return typed errors for unknown identifiers.
Before enumeration, checked arithmetic admits a declared law-work measure;
its default limit is 1,000,000 units. This measure bounds the enumerated tuple
families up to constant phase multiplicities, ordered-map lookup and label-size
costs; it is not a machine-instruction count or a wall-clock timeout.
The independent scalar challenge examines all 6,561 pairs of unital operations
on three elements using the Eckmann-Hilton characterization. Two-color examples
separately distinguish associativity, strict-unit and identity-preservation
failures. `TC` selects the designated mutation campaign for these boundaries.

Run the audit with Python 3.11+ and Cargo:

```powershell
python code/rust/quality/category_homology/run_audit.py --mutations
python code/rust/quality/category_homology/run_metrics.py
python code/rust/quality/category_homology/run_rank_proof.py
python code/rust/quality/category_homology/write_scores.py --receipt evidence/quality/category_homology/RECEIPT --metrics evidence/quality/category_homology/METRICS
python code/rust/quality/category_homology/write_scores.py --receipt evidence/quality/category_homology/RECEIPT --metrics evidence/quality/category_homology/METRICS --check
```

On this machine the bundled Python is at
`C:/Users/a343o/.cache/codex-runtimes/codex-primary-runtime/dependencies/python/python.exe`.
For a category-only replay use `--scope category`; `--mutation-prefix NT`
selects the natural-transformation campaign. Use `--only` followed by
repository-relative Rust paths when refreshing a subset of score records.
A category-only receipt is refused for homology records. This allows separate
source-bound semantic receipts without rebuilding unrelated dependencies.
`--scope homology` runs only the homology package. New replays also capture
offline Cargo metadata, resolved lockfiles, package/ancestor file hashes,
compiler binary digests, relevant flags and the exact harness. Dependency file
contents must agree before and after the replay. Mutation restoration preserves
original source bytes, including line endings. These records bind content;
they do not attest authorship or prove exact compiler file-read tracing.
The `RK` campaign covers rank-certificate faults. Historical invalid recipes
remain disclosed in their receipts, alongside corrected source-bound replays.
The `RW` mutation prefix selects designated rewriting failures. Explicit,
source-pinned gate reviews may be supplied with `--assessment` when selecting
one file with `--only`. A metric or mutation ratio never grants a grade by
itself; unreviewed gates stay null and prevent a completed score token.

The AST metric tool pins syn 3.0.9 and its dependencies in `rust_metrics/Cargo.lock`.
Eight hand-counted calibration cases cover lifetimes, closures, control flow,
guards, typed exits, test exclusion, macro opacity and malformed source. The
measurement policy is documented in its source: CCN includes typed `?` exits;
cognitive values are conservative upper bounds; closure scopes contribute to
nesting, including control expressions inside conditions. Known standard formatting/vector macro arguments are parsed, while
unknown macro bodies are explicitly opaque. Macro-generated functions and
compiler expansion require separate review. These metrics constrain structure;
they do not certify semantic correctness or automatically establish G5.

Replay copies source into an ignored snapshot and uses a distinct build
directory per run, with incremental compilation disabled. Mutations affect
only that snapshot. Completed builds delete their `target/debug` and `target/tmp`
outputs, including failed builds. The run also removes its remaining build tree
on completion, preserving source snapshots and receipts. Rebuilding dependencies
costs time; bounded disk use takes precedence. The initial and restored baselines must pass. Every
candidate is retained as killed, survived, equivalent, invalid, inconclusive,
or unrun; only eligible semantic candidates enter the conservative ratio.
Earlier failed or limited campaigns remain in the evidence directory.

The writer refuses stale source hashes, changed logs, inconsistent mutation
accounting, stale AST tool sources, or unsuccessful/restoration baselines.
Rank-model proof receipts also bind the compiler, explicit dependency search
paths, direct library inputs and clean Mathlib revision. Proof execution uses
the resolved compiler directly, excluding mutable main-project output modules.
Timeouts remain unsuccessful even if axiom reports were printed before timeout.
`--check` verifies both the adjacent YAML files and their SHA-256 manifest.
Derived score manifests live in the metric receipt, preserving historical
semantic receipts. This scoped replay does not
claim a successful build of every Rust workspace member.
