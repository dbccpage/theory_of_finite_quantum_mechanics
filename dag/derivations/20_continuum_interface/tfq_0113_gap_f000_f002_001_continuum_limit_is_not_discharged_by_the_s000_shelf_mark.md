## 1. Abstract & Formal Statement

Shelf S000 houses an inventory from finite obstruction calculus toward continuum language, with named limits and transport 2-cells and with explicit open gaps. The lifecycle word consolidated means the inventory is filled in, not that a derivation finished. Chapter 1 says the finite books on F000 and F001 remain finite and that two marks do not supply a continuum or continuum time. What is finite is a refinement sequence that may be named. What is not discharged is a curvature defect tending to a smooth Lorentzian manifold. The continuum limit remains GAP.

### Governing Obligation
GAP-F000-F002-001 continuum limit is not discharged by the S000 shelf mark.

## 2. Derivation Context & Mathematical Grounding

In accordance with strict constructive principles:
- **Zero Floating-Point Cheating**: All quantities must be evaluated using exact integer combinatorial logic, discrete fractions, or exact field extensions (e.g. cyclotomic / Gaussian integer arithmetic).
- **Explicit Valuation**: No continuum limits, Hilbert topologies, or measure spaces may be assumed prior to their explicit constructive descent.

### Admitted Structural Imports
- **Admitted**: `continuum path category (assumption)`
- **Admitted**: `refinement system and convergence certificate (assumption)`

### Epistemic Bottlenecks & Falsification Fences
> [!WARNING]
> Forward-Euler norm growth 1 + e^2 > 1 vs Cayley norm preservation is mechanized; continuum path-integral convergence remains conditional.
