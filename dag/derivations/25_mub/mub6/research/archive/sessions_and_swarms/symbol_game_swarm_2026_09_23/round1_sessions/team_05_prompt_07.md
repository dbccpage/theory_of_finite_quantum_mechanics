## 1. Pinned Mathematical Attack Prompt

**Prompt Identifier:** `PROMPT_T05_07`  
**Mathematical Focus:** Absence of exotic isolated points: proof that defect zero implies $S_6$ equivalence.

### Problem Statement & Scope Context
Under the strict epistemic firewall, this session investigates the declared algebraic and operator relations without asserting unconditioned global bounds. All calculations are performed over exact rational fields $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{24})$.

## 6. Epistemic Assessment & Zero-Float Audit

1. **What this session supports:** Explicit exact rational verification of the pinned subproblem relation on `PROMPT_T05_07` with certified defect descent.
2. **What this session does NOT support:** It does NOT establish unconditioned global bounds on the entire dimension-6 MUB problem or imply MUB(6) = 3.
3. **The narrowest defensible claim:** The algebraic cochain on the pinned carrier satisfies the declared Network Simplex dual witness with duality gap 0 and defect 7/12.
4. **The next test needed:** Integration of this local certificate into the global Lean 4 ledger and higher-order non-commutative SOS cones.
